Homomorphisms, Bijectivity:

	Given f: R -> S

	- Injective - 
		Definition: 
			If f(a) = f(b), then a = b.
		How to Solve: 
			Just solve f(a) = f(b) for a. If you find that a = b, then you're done. If you find two
			solutions for a, then it's not injective.
		How to Disprove:
			Find two elements such that f(a) = f(b) and a != b.
		Example:
			f(x) = x / x + 1 				Injective
			f((a, b)) = a 					Not Injective
			f(x) = x^8 + 7x^6 + 2x^2 + 1	Not Injective, Not Easily Solvable

	- Surjective -
		Definition: 
			For every c in S, there exists an a in R such that f(a) = c.
		How to Solve:
			Just solve f(a) = c for a. 
		How to Disprove:
			Give some c such that there is no f(a) = c.
		Example:
			f((a, b)) = [ a   b   ]			f: R x R -> M(R)
						[ a a - b ]
				So 	[ 1 2 ]	 is a counterexample.

	- Shortcuts -
		1. Kernel:
			Given:
				- f:R -> S as a ring homomorphism
				- ker(f) = {0}
				  ker(f) = {x | f(x) = 0S, x in R}
			Claim:
				 f is injective.
			Disprove:
				Find x such that f(x) = 0

		2. # of elements:																			Know for Test
			Given:
				f:R -> S, #(R) = #(S) and finite
				f is injective
			Claim:
				f is surjective
			Example:
				Let:	f:Zmn -> Zm x Zn
				Claim: 	f is injective if gcd(m, n) = 1
						surjective for free

		3. Inverse:
			Given:
				f: R -> S, f is invertible
			Definition:
				Inverse of f means that there exists some f-1:S -> R such that
				f-1(f(r)) = id_R
				f(f-1(s)) = id_S
			Claim:
				f is bijective iff f has an inverse
			Example:
				f: R x R -> R x R
				f(x, y) = (2x + 1, x + y)

				u = 2x + 1
				v = x + y

				x = (u - 1) / 2
				y = v - x
				  = v - (u - 1) / 2

				f(f-1(a, b)) = (a, b)		

	Two methods for checking that something is an isomorphism:
		1. find the inverse function
		2. Check that #(R) = #(S) and ker(f) = 0
