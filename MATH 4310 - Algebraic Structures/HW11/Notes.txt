4.1:
	- Definition of R[x]
	
	- if p(x) deg n, q(x) deg m are in R[x], then p(x) * q(x) = c(x) deg ≤ m + n
		c_l = Sum(i + j = e)(a_i * b_j)
	- leading coefficient of product is product of leading coefficients
	- constant coefficient of product is product of constant coefficients

	- Special case when R is a field F. In F[x] you can do long division.

	Examples:
		Define a mapping from Z[x] to Z[x] by the following:
			  f(x) = sum( a_i * x^i )
			D(f(x)) = sum ( i * a_i * x^i-1 )

		Question: Is D a ring homomorphism?	
		
			D is not a ring homomorphism

4.2:
	- Divisibility
		IN Z:
			1. def of div.
			2. g.c.d.
			3. primality
			4. Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

		IN Z[x]:
			1. def of div.
			2. gcd
			3. primality
			4. Fundamental Theorem of Polynomials 

4.3:
	- F[x]'s irreducible is analagous to Z's prime.
	- f(x) in F[x] if :
		- WARNING: f(x) = 3x^2 + 2 in Q

		a polynomial is reducible iff
			f(x) = g(x)h(x)		where the degree of g(x) ≥ 1 and degree of h(x) ≥ 1

	- Every polynomial factors as a product of irreducibles

	Examples:
		Is x^2 - 3 irreducible?

		In Q[x] : no
		in R[x] : yes sqrt(3)
		in M_2(R)[x] : sometimes?

		-----

		prove that [a b] is a subring?
				   [0 c]

		-----

		polynomial with leading coefficient 1 is called Monic

		-----

		If x^2 - 3 were reducible, then 
			x^2 - 3 = (ax + b)(cx + d)			* Hint: looking for contradiction
			x^2 - 3 = a(x + r) * c(x + s)		!!!
			x^2 - 3 = ac(x + r)(x + s)
			ac = 1 								coeff. of x^2
			x^2 - 3 = (x + r)(x + s)
					= x^2 + rx + sx + rs
					= x^2 + (r + s)x + rs

			0 = r + s   => s = -r
			-3 = rs     => -3 = -r^2

			3 = r^2   !Contradiction!

		There is no rational number r with r^2 = 3, so there is no factorization of x^2 - 3 in Q[x].

		-----

		Is x3 + x + 1 irreducible in Z2[x]?

			x3 + x + 1 = f(x)g(x)		f(x) deg 1
										g(x) deg 2

			f(x) = {x, x + 1}
			g(x) = x^2 + {0 | 1}x + {0 | 1}

4.4:
	
	Let f(x) in R[x]. We can evaluate f(x) for a in R
		if f(a) = 0 then a is a zero of the polynomial (Like a root of the function)

	You can always take a polynomial and get a function
	You don't always know the polynomial from the function

	Remainder Theorem:
		Let f(x) be a polynomial inside of F[x]. Let a in F, and consider x - a.					* Know for test
		By the division algorithm, when we divide f(x) by (x - a), the remainder will have degreee 
		r(x) < 1 => r(x) = 0.
		If the remainder has degree 0, then r(x) is just a constant. 
		f(x) = g(x)(x - a) + b 																		* !!!

		f(a) = g(a)(a - a) + b
			 = 0 + b
			 = b

		f(x) = g(x)(x - a) + f(a) 		: Remainder Theorem
		(x - a) is a factor of f(x) iff f(a) = 0, a is a zero of the polynomial.

	Example:
		Is f(x) = x3 + x + 1 irreducible in Z2[x]?													* Know for test
		If f is reducible, it must be factored into a linear and quadratic term, or three linears.
		Because degree of f = 3, degree of factors must be 3 = 1 + 1 + 1, or 3 = 1 + 2

		f(a):
			a = 0: f(0) = 1
			a = 1: f(1) = 1

		No roots, no zeroes, therefore irreducible.

		Irreducible problems for degree less than or equal to three is the same as finding zeroes.
