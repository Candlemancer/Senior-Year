Let R be a ring. Then
	f:R[x] -> R

Where R[x] is a polynomial with Ground Ring R, or in other words:
	f(a_n * x^n + ... + a2 * x^2 + a1 * x + a0) -> a0
	- This is a ring homomorphism

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let R, S be rings, with f as a ring homomorphism. Define 
	F: R[x] -> S[x]
Then plug everything into f, and F is a ring homomorphism called the 								* Know for test.
	Change of Coefficients Homomorphism.

The Dreaded Division Algorithm:

	- n = aq + b																		   0 â‰¤ b < q
	- p(x) = a(x)q(x) + r(x)  							   Where the degree of r(x) < degree of q(x)

Division Algorithm leads to gcd algorithm
Division Algorithm leads to factorization

Therfore, any polynomial can be factored into products of primes

Warning! 
	Suppose we are trying to factor in a ring:
	a = bc
	Then
	a = b(u * u-1)c
	  = bu * u-1(c)

	Ex. 6 = 2 * 3 = -2 * -3

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Zero Divisors: 		ab = 0, 	a != 0, b != 0
2. Unit:				ab = 1 = ba
3. Associates: 			a = bu 		u is a unit.
	Two elements, a, b in R are called associates if a = bu and u is a unit.

	Ex. Z10
		ZD: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
		U: 1, 3, 7, 9
		A: {2, 6}, {4, 6}
			2 * 3 = 6, associates
			5 is not an associate of 8
			4 * 9 = 6

	Ex. 3x3 Matrices
		A = BP
		If A, B are associates, then A, B must have same rank.

When we talk about the factorization of polynomials, we can say that the factorization is unique
up to associates.

Ex. Pg 99, #5.a
	Find the GCD of x4 - x3 - x2 + 1 and x3 - 1 		in Q[x]

		(x - 1)(x2 + x + 1)

		x3(x - 1) - (x2 - 1)
		x2(x - 1) - (x - 1)(x + 1)
		(x - 1)(x2 - (x + 1))
		(x - 1)(x2 - x - 1)

		p(x) = a(x)b(x) + r(x)

				  x   -1
		x3 - 1 | x4 - x3 - x2 + 0x + 1
				 x4             -x
				  0 - x3 - x2 +  x + 1
				    - x3		   + 1
				         - x2 +  x + 0

		= (x3 - 1)(x - 1) + (-x2 + x)
		     a       b			 r   


		     	  -x    -1
		-x2 + x | x3 + 0x2 + 0x - 1
				  x3 -  x2
				  		x2		- 1
				  	    x2 -  x
				  	    	  x - 1
		=> x - 1 is the gcd


	(x - 1)   = (x3 - 1) - (-x - 1)(-x2 + x)
	(-x2 + x) = (x4 - x3 - x2 + 1) - (x3 - 1)(x - 1)
