Isomorphisms:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rough Idea:																							Know for Test!
	Two rings R and S are isomorphic if they have all the same algebraic properties.

Examples of properties:
	- R is commutative
	- R has a multiplicative identity
	- R is an integral domain
	- R has five units

Remark:
	There will be a Cartesian Product on the test, never integral domains, have zero divisors		Know for Test	

Definition:
	Homomorphism (pg. 75): 
		Let f: R -> S 
		Let f be a function mapping R to S. f is a homomorphism if it preserves addition and 
		multiplication.
		- f(a +_R b) = f(a) +_S f(b)		a, b in R
		- f(a *_R b) = f(a) *_S f(b)		a, b in R

		Ex:
		f: Z -> Z 		f(n) = 2n
		0 -> 0
		1 -> 2
		5 -> 10
		f(a + b) = 2(a + b) = 2a + 2b
		f(a) + f(b) = 2a + 2b
			Addition is preserved!
		f(ab) = 2(ab) = 2ab
		f(a) * f(b) = 2a * 2b = 4ab
			Multiplication is not!
		Domain: All integers
		Range: All integers
		Image: All even integers

		Ex:
		f: Z -> Z 		f(n) = n + 1
		3 -> 4
		4 -> 5
		Domain: Z
		Range: Z
		Image: Z
		a + b -> (a + b) + 1 
		a -> a + 1
		b -> b + 1
		f(a) + f(b) = a + b + 2
		ab -> ab + 1
		f(a)f(b) = (a + 1)(b + 1) 

		Ex:
		F: C -> C 		f(a + ib) = a - ib
		0 + 0i -> 0 - 0i
		1 + 0i -> 1 - 0i
		u = a + ib
		v = c + id
		f(u + v) = f((a + c) + (b + d)i) = a + c - (b + d)i
		f(u) + f(v) = a - bi + c - di = a + c - (b + d)i
			Addition is preserved!
		f(uv) = ac + adi + cbi - bd
			  = (ac - bd) + (ad + cb)i
			  = (ac - bd) - (ad + cb)i
			Multiplication is preserved
		Complex conjucation (f) is a ring homomorphism.
		Domain: C
		Range: C
		Image: C

	Remark:
		Domain: Everything mapped from R
		Range: 	Everything that could be mapped to in S 
		Image:  Everything that actually is mapped to in S

Theorem 3.10:
	If f is a homomorphism then the following must be true:
		f(0R) = 0S
		f(1R) = 1S

Review:
	Given f: R -> S

	One-to-one: f maps every distinct element of R to a distinct element of S
	f(a) = f(b) => a = b
	(Only domain matters)
	
	Onto: Every element of S is mapped to from an element of R
	For every x in S, there is an a in R such that f(a) = x
	(Only range matters)

Definition:
	Isomorphism:
		Let R and S be rings. A mapping f from R to S is an isomorphism if 
			1. f is a homomorphism
			2. f is one-to-one
			3. f is onto

	Shortcuts for one-to-one and onto:
		Suppose R and S are finite rings and the cardinality(#) of R = #(S). 
		If f is one-to-one then f is onto and vice versa. (f is a bijection)
		(Sometimes called the pigeonhole principle)

		In linear algebra the same thing happens. 
		Given ɸ: V -> W
		if dim(V) = dim(W)
		then ɸ is one-to-one => ɸ is onto.

Examples of algebraic properties:
	Let R, S be rings. Suppose f: R -> S is a ring isomorphism.
	If R is commutative, show that S is commutative.

	Let u, v be in S. To prove that S is commutative, we will show that uv = vu.					* Know for Test
	Since f is onto, we know that there must be a distinct m,n in R such that m -> u
	and n -> v. 

	uv = f(m) * f(n)
	   = f(mn)
	   = f(nm)
	   = f(n) * f(m)
	   = vu

Section 3.3 pt 2:


Ring Homomorphism:

	Given f: R -> S 	a, b in R
	f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b)
	f(a * b) = f(a) * f(b)

	Domain: R
	Range: S

	To show that f is a homomorphism, just work out each side.
	To show that f is not a homomorism, just give a counterexample.


f is one-to-one (injective) [f(a) = f(b) => a = b]
f is onto (surjective) [for any b in S, there exists an a in R such that f(a) = b]					* Exact definition
both together are called bijective.


Fancy Words:

	Monomorphism: injective homomorphism
	Epimorphism: surjective homomorphism
	Isomorphism: bijective homomorphism
	Automorphism: self-mapping isomorpism


Theorem 3.10:

	If f: R -> S is a homomorpism:
	1. 0 -> 0																						* Know proofs for test	
	2, 3. f(a - b) = f(a) - f(b)
	4. if f is surjective and R has an identity, then S must have an identity.						*
	5. if R and S have identities, and a is a unit in R, then f(a) is a unit in S. 					*

	Proof 1:
		Let f(0R) = Z
		f(0) = f(0 + 0)
			 = f(0) + f(0).
		Z = Z + Z 					(Rings can always cancel additively.)
		0S = Z

	Proof 4:
		Let f(1R) = e.
		Because f is onto, there is an a in R such that f(a) = b.
		b * e = f(1) * f(a)
			  = f(a * 1)
			  = f(a)
		b * e = b

	Proof 5:
		If a is a unit in R.
		ax = 1R
		f(a * x) = f(a) * f(x)
		1S = f(a) * f(x)

	Corollary:
		If f:R -> S is an isomorpism, then 
			# of units in R = # of units in S

		Show that Z2 x Z4 is not isomorphic to Z8.
		Proof:
			Count the number of units.

			Remark: The units in Zn are all numbers relatively prime to n.

			Units in Z8: 1, 3, 5, 7
			Units in Z2 x Z4: 
				Units in Z2 x Units in Z4
				([1], [1]), ([1], [3])

			Since 
			# units in Z8 != # Units in Z2 x Z4
			4 != 2
			The two are not isomorphic.

	Exercise:
		Is Z3 isomorphic to M(Z2)

Remark:
	Collect a list of properties to check:
	- # of elements
	- # of units
	- commutativity
	- 0 maps to 0
	- identity
	- field-ness
	- # of zero divisors (integral domain-ness)

Images:
	Let f:R -> S be a ring homomorphism.
	Image(f) = {b in S | b = f(a) for a in R}
	If f is a homomorphism, then the image space is Im(f) is a subring of S.

	Proof:
		Let x, y be in Im(f).
		To prove that Im(f) is a subring, we will show that Im(f) is closed under subtraction and
		multiplication
			x - y in Im(f)
			x * y in Im(f)

		Since x, y in Im(f), there are a, b such that 
			f(a) = x, 
			f(b) = y.

			x - y = f(a) - f(b)
				  = f(a - b)

			So x - y is in the image of f
			Same thing for products.
