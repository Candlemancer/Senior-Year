	- gcd(a, b) => d can be expressed as d = ua + vb.
	- If you find u, v such that 1 = ua + bv, then the gcd of a, b = 1
		since if c | a, b then c | 1, or that c = |1|, gcd(c) = 1.
		Can be used to prove that the gcd of (a, b) = 1.

	- theorem 1.4 pg 14 is fair game for the test.
	Proof:
		Since gcd(a, b) = 1, we can use the linear combination properties of the gcd to write 

			1 = au + bv   		u, v are ints

		We also know that a | bc, or that 

			bc = ak.

		So:

			c = acu + bcv
			  = acu + akv
			  = a(cu + kv)

		since (cu + kv) is an integer, 

			c = am			m is int
			a | c ;

	if p | ab, then p | a or p | b

	- FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ARITHMETIC
	- gcd = 1 implies no shared prime factors.

Feb 9th.

	A Zero Divisor in Zn is any congruence class [a] such that [a][b] = [0] in Zn, with a and b
	both being nonzero elements of Zn. You can find the Zero Divisors by finding all of the 
	factors of [0] in Zn.

	Addendum: There are no zero divisors if n is prime

	[a] = [b] in Zn means that [a] and [b] represent the same congruence class, or in other words 
	a = kn + i and b = jn + i for i, j, k in Z.

	[a] is a unit if [a][b] = [1], ergo [a] != [0] and [a] is not a Zero Divisor. Also [a] is a unit
	if gcd(a, n) = 1

	Know for test:
		- calculate the inverse of a unit.

	Example:
		Find [9]^-1 [15]^-1 in Z28

		1. Use the Euclidean Algorithm

			28 = 3(9) + 1			28 = 1(15) + 13
									15 = 1(13) + 2
									13 = 6(2) + 1

		2. Rewrite the GCD as a linear combination

			1 = au + bn 	mod n
			1 = au 			mod n

		3. Solve for all for all of the remainders

			1 = 28 - 3(9)			13 = 28 - 15
			[1] = [0] - [3][9]		2 = 15 - 13
			[1] = [25][9]			1 = 13 - 6(2)

			[9]^-1 = [25]			1 = 13 - 6(15 - 13)
									1 = (28 - 15) - 6(15 - (28 - 15))
									1 = 28 - 15 - 6(15) + 6(28) - 6(15)
									1 = 7(28) - 13(15)

									[1] = [-13][15] in Z28
									[-13] = [15]


	Why does the division algorithm work to give the GCD?

		a = bq + r
		b = rs - t
		...

	It's easy to remember why this works. It is simply the fact that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r) ...

	Why is that true?

		Let A be the set of divisors of a, b,
		let B be the set of divisors of b, r.

		We will show that A = B, and therefore that max(A) = max(B), which is by definition the GCD,
		and so gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r).

		Let c \in A.

			c | a 	=> a = kc
			c | b 	=> b = lc

		By using the division algorithm, we see that

			kc = lcq + r
			r = kc - lcq
			r = c(k - lq)

		Ergo, c | r, and since c | b and c | r, c is in B.
		Now show the same for d \in B.

	Find the inverse of [2] + [3]i in Z5, i = sqrt(-1).

	(a + bi)-1 = (a - bi) / (a^2 + b^2)																Know for test, really.
	(2 + 3i)-1 = (2 - 3i) / (4 + 9)
	[2] + [3]i-1 = [2] - [3]i ([4] + [9])-1
				 = [2] - [3]i ([3])-1
				 = [2]([2] - [3]i)
				 = [4] - [6]i
				 = [4] - [1]i
