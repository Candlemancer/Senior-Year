Joint distribution:

	RV's X, Y
	f(x, y)

	- f(x, y) must be nonnegative and integrate to 1
	- To find CDF, integrate from -infiity to x, -infinity to y of f(x, y) (f(u, v))
	- marginal densities is integrating in the other variable
	- conditional density funciton is f(x, Y = y) (y constant) = f(x,y) / f(y)
	- Expected value of x | y = integral from -inf to inf of x(f(x | y)) dx 

Chapter 2 - Random Variables:
	
	Discrete RV: 
		- Bernoulli:			f(x) = {1 	p 		if success, 
										0 	1 - p 	if failure}

		- Binomial(n, p):		How many trials until n successes:
								f(k) = P(X = k) = (n C k) * p^k * q^(n - k)

		- Geometric	:			How many times until first success:
								f(k) = q^(k - 1)p

		- Negative Binomial:	How many times until r successes:
								f(k) = (k - 1 C r - 1) * p^r * q^(k - r)

		- Hypergeometric: 		Exactly the conditional probability.

		- Poisson(l):			Poisson is the limit of the binomial
								l = np
								f(k) = (l^k / k!)e^(-l)

	Continuous RV:
		- Gamma:				f(x) = (l^a / g(a)) * x^(a - 1) * e^(-lx)		x ≥ 0
								Maximum: 
									f'(x) = c(a - 1)x^(a - 2)e^(-lx) - le(-lx)cx^(a - 1)
										  = cx^(a - 2)e^-lx[a - 1 - lx] = 0
									x = (a - 1) / l

		- Exponential:			f(x) = le^(-lx) 	x ≥ 0

		- Normal: 				f(x) = (1 / √(2π)s) * e^(-(x - µ) / 2s^2)

Chapter 1 - Sample spaces and probability measures:
	
	Example: 
		From an ordinary deck of 52 cards, cards are drawn successively until the first ace is 
		drawn. What is the probability that the first ace is drawn at the nth draw?

		P(X) = 	(48 C n - 1) * n - 1
				(52 C n)

		What is the probability that the first ace appears after the nth draw?

		P(X) = P(not ace for n draws)	= 	(48 C n)
											(52 C n)
